What is Vectras VM?

Vectras VM is a Virtual Machine Application That Allows You to Run Alot of Operating System Including (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux and etc...) not Just an HTML file That Makes You Feel Like Having a PC. NO It's The Actual Operating System With All of It's Programs and Yea They All Work Just Fine.

Not Only Just Experiencing it but Also Running PC Programs on It. Of Course You Won't be Able to Run Modern Games on it but Retro Ones Works Just Fine With Good FPS But It's Not Only About Gaming You can Also Programme on It Using (Sublime Text Editor, Code::Blocks and etc..)

Sooo How is The Performance?

Welll.. It Depends on The Hardware For Example if You Have a Low End Phone It Will Struggle With Modern OS (So We Added Windows 95,98,ME,CE and Kolibiri OS) and if You Have a Flagship Phone Modern OS Will Run Just Fine

Soooo That's All You Want to Know about Vectras VM :D
